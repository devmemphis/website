DevMemphis is back for 2021!

For our first meetup of the year, Dylan Ledbetter will lead a conversation on how to make incredible maps using the Speedtest by Ookla Global Network Performance datasets now available on the AWS Open Data Registry.

Ookla’s mission is to make the internet better, faster and more accessible for everyone.
Fixed and mobile network providers, governments, regulatory bodies and other businesses around the world rely on Ookla’s data and enterprise solutions to inform business decisions, improve network performance and increase internet accessibility.

Through our Ookla for Good program, we regularly provide data on a complimentary basis to policy makers, humanitarian organizations and academic research institutions working to bridge the digital divide and improve people’s lives by improving internet access.

Another goal of Ookla for Good is to make data accessible and open to those individuals seeking to understand and improve the state of networks worldwide. Recently, we were excited to announce the launch of our Ookla Open Datasets via the AWS Public Dataset Program!

Join us for an overview of the Speedtest by Ookla Global Network Performance dataset and the stunning maps it has inspired, followed by a brief tutorial on how to build your own.
