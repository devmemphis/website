Tired of typing out the same long commands over and over? Come learn about Make and how Makefiles can simplify long and complex command line tasks such as managing dependencies, creating test environments, executing test suites, and even deploying our application. We can even simplify our CICD tasks and use Makefiles to create repeatable steps that we can run locally to debug complex CICD scenarios.
This month Juwan Moore will be giving a talk about dependency injection.
