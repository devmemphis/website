This talk will focus on empowering individuals in technical fields who identify as introverts to build meaningful professional connections, emphasizes overcoming the challenges introverts often face in social or networking scenarios, and provides practical strategies to navigate them.

My name is JC Smiley, a passionate builder of tech communities and software. Since 2018, I've had the incredible privilege of being one of the volunteer leaders of the Code Connector community. Recently, I launched the Memphis Tech Scene newsletter to shine a light on the vibrant tech events happening in Memphis. Iâ€™m truly excited to discuss how introverts can not only navigate but thrive in an extrovert-driven world.
