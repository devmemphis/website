title: 27. The Rust Programming Language
date: "2021-08-10T22:12:03.284Z"
description: "Rust has seen a lot of hype and praise from the developer community over the past few years despite it being a relatively new programming language (about 10 years old). Rust has been crowned the most loved language by Stackoverflow’s Developer Survery for the past 5 years straight. In this talk, I’ll give you guys a brief summary of Rust as a language and what problems it intends to address as well as why I personally enjoy using it. I’ll also do some live code examples to demonstrate Rust’s flagship feature: owner ship."

After a few months off, we're back for our 27th DevMemphis meetup with Ray Green who will be giving a talk about the Rust programming language. This is an online event that's free to anyone interested in joining.

Talk Description
Rust has seen a lot of hype and praise from the developer community over the past few years despite it being a relatively new programming language (about 10 years old). Rust has been crowned the most loved language by Stackoverflow’s Developer Survery for the past 5 years straight. In this talk, I’ll give you guys a brief summary of Rust as a language and what problems it intends to address as well as why I personally enjoy using it. I’ll also do some live code examples to demonstrate Rust’s flagship feature: owner ship.

Speaker Bio
My name is Ray Green and I’ve been a Memphis resident basically all my life. I fell into the world of software development in 2018 as a college dropout. After attending courses with Tech901 and Codecrew’s Codeschool (two nonprofits here in town), I landed my first Dev role at the tail end of 2018 before switching to my current role GreenMountain in mid 2019.
