Have you ever wanted to set up a continuous integration and delivery pipeline for your web app? In this talk, I will show you how you can do this for free. We will take an application from creation all the way to automated deployment without fear by using GitHub Actions, Cypress, Next.js, Vercel, and a few other tools in between!

Presenter: Carter Capocaccia, Senior Manager of Quality Automation @ Hilton. Carter focuses on empowering rapid delivery for enterprise web applications by leveraging automation and CI/CD pipelines.
