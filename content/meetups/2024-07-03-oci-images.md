We will discuss OCI Images: what they are, where they live, and how to build them efficiently. We’ll talk about layers, registries, and build strategies. This is not a presentation about building Dockerfiles; we might briefly visit Docker tools, but we’re going to focus largely on OCI Images without Docker.
