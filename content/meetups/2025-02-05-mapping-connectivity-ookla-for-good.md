Ookla for Good (OFG) is an internal organization dedicated to leveraging Ookla's connectivity insights for social impact. As part of this mission, we publish valuable network performance datasets to the Registry of Open Data on AWS, enabling researchers, developers, and policymakers to analyze and visualize internet accessibility worldwide. In this talk we'll answer who is OFG, how does OFG open source it's data, and what can you do with the data.

I'm Bryce and I've been working at Ookla since 2019. I'm excited to talk about the Ookla for Good Open Data Initiative for two main reasons: 1. OFG is an employee initiated internal organization that has great intentions and 2. almost all of the Big Data work I do is confidential, so its nice to have actual work data I can reference outside of the office
