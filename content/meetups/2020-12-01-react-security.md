Abstract:
There’s more to building React applications than creating a few components and calling it a day. Before you push to production, you need to make sure you put special thought into protecting your users. In this talk, we’ll discuss core concepts in authentication vs authorization an well as front-end vs back-end security. You will walk away knowing what considerations you need to address to make your React applications are secure.
