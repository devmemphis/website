This meetup will mark 1 year since our first meetup. Come celebrate 1 year of DevMemphis!

This month Kevin Nuckolls of Ookla will be giving a talk about the new terminal in Windows and using Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL)

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables (in ELF format) natively on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019.

Windows Terminal is a new, modern, fast, efficient, powerful, and productive terminal application for users of command-line tools and shells like Command Prompt, PowerShell, and WSL.
