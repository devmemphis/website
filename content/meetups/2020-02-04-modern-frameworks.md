Come hang out and eat pizza with Memphis developers.

Many of us found ourselves attracted to DevOps or Agile because of the promises made - faster, better, easier, and more stable platforms were within our reach now if we just do these few things, right?

Learn how to get the most out of the promises of modern frameworks like DevOps, Agile, and Microservices by exploring the problems being solved and asking the right questions.
