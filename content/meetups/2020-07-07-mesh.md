Outline:
Service meshes normally target the application space, but they can be used to great effect for sources within the infrastructure. We will explore the concept of implementing a service mesh for interacting with infrastructure sources using a declarative resource protocol. This approach provides users with a single mechanism for executing RPC calls and pub/sub operations as well as accessing object class definitions across products from various vendors.
