Talk Description:
How did state management become such a hot topic in web application development in such a short time - or was it there all along?
We'll explore the concept of state in software and how it relates to complexity; look back at some history that led us to where we are now in regard to state management in web apps; and discuss how state management solutions like redux, mobx, React's useReducer, and react query fit in to the picture.
